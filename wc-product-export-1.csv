691,"Roland D-50","The D-50 was the first affordable synthesizer to combine <a title=""Sample-based synthesis"" href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample-based_synthesis"">sample playback</a> with subtractive synthesis. The engineers at Roland determined that the most difficult component of an instrument's sound to simulate realistically is the attack. To better emulate realistic sounds, the D-50 included 47 attack samples in ROM. The synthesizer played back an attack sample which was dove-tailed with more conventional subtractive synthesis to create the sustain of the sound. This dual-use method was required in 1987 since RAM was so expensive. Roland did, however, incorporate a number of <i>texture</i> samples that could be mixed into the synthesized sustain part of a patch. These sustain samples gave many D-50 patches a lush and airy quality.",1895,"Synthesizers > Roland","Digital, Roland, Synthesizer",https://luism.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/image_2024-02-26_221905879-Photoroom.png-Photoroom-e1708982540954.png,Brand,roland,1,1,Phaseout,1991,1,0,Aftertouch,yes,1,0,"Velocity expression",yes,1,0,Keyboard,"61 keys",1,0,"External control","MIDI in/out\, pedal switch\, pedal hold\, EXT Control\, EXT Pedal",1,0

742,"Roland Jupiter-4","The JP-4 was an analog synthesizer made by Roland Corporation from 1978 to 1981. It was significant as the first self-contained polyphonic synthesizer and for using digital control of analog circuits, known as compuphonic, which allowed for features like programmable memory, voice assignment modes, an arpeggiator, and more.  While it didn't have as many sales as its competitors, its design made it suitable for use with organs and even had the option for a music sheet stand. Its successor, the Jupiter-8, was released in 1981 and became a popular brand.",2895,"Synthesizers > Roland","Analogue, Roland",https://luism.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/image_2024-02-24_003046136.png,Dates,"1978 - 1981",1,1,Polyphony,"4 Voices",1,1,"Synthesis type","Analog subtractive",1,1,Keyboard,"49 keys",1,1,,,,,,,,

746,"Roland JX-8P","The Roland JX-8P, an almost entirely analog synthesizer, was released in 1985 and boasted 61 keys. It featured velocity and aftertouch sensitivity and six-note polyphony. Despite the increasing popularity of digital frequency modulation synthesizers like the Yamaha DX7, the JX-8P offered an optimal mix of both types, optimizing the creation of traditional analog synth sounds, while enabling the production of some FM synthesis-related sounds due to new modulation parameters and redesigned hardware. A Yamaha DX7-style interface with membrane buttons and one ""edit"" slider replaced traditional hands-on controls. The JX-8P's predecessors were the JX-3P and the rack MKS-30. It was one of the last true analog synthesizers produced by Roland in the 1980s, joined later by Alpha Juno 1/2 synths, racks MKS-50 and MKS-70, and then finally the JX-10. The famous opening brass fanfare of Europe's 1986 hit ""The Final Countdown"" was produced through a preset patch layered on a Yamaha TX816 using JX-8P. Eric Persing and Dan DeSouza created the factory presets on the JX-8P.",1695,"Synthesizers > Roland","Analogue, Roland, Synthesizer",https://luism.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/image_2024-02-26_220647640-removebg-e1708981905377.png,Polyphony,"6 Voices",1,1,"Synthesis type","Analog subtractive",1,1,"External control",MIDI,1,1,Brand,roland,1,1,Keyboard,"61 notes",1,1,Dates,1985-1989,1,1
